# BMI_Calculator_Python
ðŸ“„ Project Overview

In this project, a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator was created using Python to provide general health insights based on user-entered height and weight.
The program calculates BMI, classifies it into health categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese), and displays the result clearly to the user.
